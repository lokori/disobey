## How to hack?

* Ask for help and clarifications if necessary.. but first, do & try & try again.
* There are more than one way of discovering and exploiting things..
* Don't crash the server if you figure out a way to do it. 

## Afterwards

* Continue with Google Gruyere
* Hack something else too, like OWASP Juice Shop
* Go for bug bounties perhaps?
* If you are a developer, learn more about hacking and make better software for us all.
